# iTerm Instant Replay Control

When in an iTerm console window, you can roll back time using the Instant Replay Control - <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>.

## Use Cases
Instant Replay will replay output as well as input - so you can:
* revisit the content of a `git log` that has terminated
* replay a `yarn install` to see the total packages fetched
