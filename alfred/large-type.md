# Large Type

Alfred's **Large Type** is a feature that allows you to show text in large characters across your screen – handy for workshops and presentations!

 You can use <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> at any time to show the text.

 You can alter the way it looks by going to `Preferences > Features > Large Type`. You can optionally fill the screen or show the text on the monitor your mouse is present, for example.
