# PHP REPL

When using PHP v5.1.0 or above, you can use the command `php -a` to access an interactive PHP shell on the command line. This functions similarly to other REPLs, such as Ruby's `irb` and Node's `node` command and is great for directly executing a few lines of code for a quick test.

Use `exit` to quit the shell
